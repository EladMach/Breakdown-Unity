# Breakout Game
Welcome to the Breakout Game! This is a simple yet entertaining game developed in Unity where you'll have a blast breaking bricks and testing your reflexes. Use the paddle to bounce the ball and break all the bricks to win each level.

Gameplay Instructions:
Objective: Your goal is to clear each level of all the bricks by hitting them with the ball. The ball must not fall below the paddle, or you'll lose a life. Complete all levels to win the game.

Paddle Control: Move the paddle horizontally using the left and right arrow keys or by dragging it with the mouse/touch input.

Ball Movement: The ball will bounce off the paddle and walls. Aim to hit it at different angles to reach all the bricks. If the ball goes beyond the paddle, you'll lose a life.

Brick Breaking: Break bricks by hitting them with the ball. Some bricks require multiple hits to break. Different bricks might have power-ups that fall when broken â€“ catch them with the paddle for special effects.

Power-Ups: Power-ups can provide benefits like a wider paddle, extra balls, or the ability to shoot projectiles. Use these power-ups strategically to your advantage.

Level Progression: Each level presents a new arrangement of bricks. As you advance, the game might introduce new challenges, such as faster ball speed or more complex brick formations.

Lives: You typically start with a set number of lives. Losing all lives will result in a game over. Try to complete the game with the fewest lives lost.
